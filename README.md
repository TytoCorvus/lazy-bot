I am a project created to do silly or tedious things like scroll Twitter so my users don't have to!

I can do the following for you:
Direct me to look at a particular twitter handle for a set of keywords from the discord channel of your choice, and I will begin to look for tweets by that user on a regular interval. If I find something, I'll make a link in your discord for this tweet and mention the users that have requested to listen to this monitor. The most common use cases for this functionality include news updates regarding specific topics and getting release updates on something you are expecting (A game or album release, for example).
    
I also do some other things like link music JoJo music to make some of my friends happy. Have fun!
