I am a baby project created on a stupid whim

I can do things though, I swear.
Some day I hope to:
    - Watch for Tierzoo uploads on Youtube
    - Provide stupid responses to stupid questions
    - Remind Bryce his stream died
    - Write a popcorn emoji when 3+ people are streaming
    - Investigate top 8 speedrun times???
    - monitor Twitter for game release dates //Team Cherry + Silksong, Toby Fox + Deltarune, From Software + Elden Ring
    - Shame people for using ellipsis incorrectly
    - RIP
    - JOJO references (Link for random JOJO theme?)
